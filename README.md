👋 Hi, I’m June Hong.
I have ten years of software development experience and twelve years of management experience leading software teams at advanced software companies. I managed the development of a cloud-based device management platform for internet phones and software for smart mobile devices. I worked with the teams of Samsung, NTT, and NEC and delivered the cloud-based device management platform to NEC, multimedia SDK for mobile phones to Samsung, and android OS for tablets to NTT. With a significant amount of experience in leading the development of cloud-based applications and software for smart mobile devices, I have strong organizational planning and development, business judgment, technical leadership, and communication skills. I am enthusiastic 👀 💞️ about preventing potential problems and developing forward-thinking solutions.
